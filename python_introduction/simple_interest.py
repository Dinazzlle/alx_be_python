# Define the variables
principal = 1000      # Initial investment (P)
rate = 0.05           # Annual interest rate (R) as a decimal
time = 3              # Time in years (T)

# Calculate simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
